# NemoVote client

This is a client to connect and interact with [https://nemovote.com/](NemoVote).

It is completely unofficial and just made to help myself with create users and updating lists.

It is written in PowerShell and you can get an idea of usage based on the scripts in the tst folder.


# Sample

The CreateVoters.ps1 script in root can read voters from Google Sheet and create as users in NemoVote and get assigned to voting lists depending on number of votes/rows in Google Sheet.
